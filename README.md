# IoTFever Game

This game is a single player game, whereby the player is presented certain dance moves on the screen and he or she has to mimic the move and gets points for doing the move right. The actual move data is collected from TI sensortags (accelormeter sensor) that the player puts on. To access and describe the functionality of those TI sensortags we use Vorto http://vorto.eclipse.org/. 

- Stage 1: Use 2 sensor tags on left and right arm, being able to understand certain arm positions. 
- Stage 2:  Additional sensors detecting movement from legs
